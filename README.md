# SPY Volatility Forecasting using LSTM Neural Networks

This project implements deep learning techniques (specifically LSTM neural networks) using TensorFlow/Keras for forward volatility forecasting. Results are measured in isolation and as compared to classical methods of volatility forecasting (e.g. GARCH).
